# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
# Problem statement
Given Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset, which contains data for over 14000 tweets, your task is to predict the sentiment of the tweet i.e. positive, negative or neutral.

# You are given:

1. A Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data
2. A X test File and you have to predict and submit predictions for this file.
Read Instructions carefully -

1. Files are in csv format.
2. Submit a csv file with only predictions for X test data. File should not have any headers and should only have one column i.e. predictions. 
3. Submit your ipynb file as well.
4. Your score is based on number of accurate predictions.

5. # Start
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains tweets about various airlines and their corresponding sentiments, which are classified as positive, negative, or neutral.

    ```

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Loads the dataset containing tweets and their associated sentiments.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the tweet text for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Applies machine learning models to classify the sentiment of tweets.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of the sentiment analysis model using various metrics.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains tweets about various airlines and their corresponding sentiments. The data is stored in `train.csv` and includes the following columns:

- `tweet_id`: Unique identifier for the tweet
- `airline_sentiment`: Sentiment of the tweet (positive, negative, neutral)
- `airline`: Airline mentioned in the tweet
- `text`: The tweet text
- Other columns related to metadata

## Model

The model used for sentiment analysis is built using machine learning techniques. The process involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the tweet text.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Extracting relevant features from the text data.
3. **Model Training:** Training a machine learning model on the processed data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
